## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

This is an analysis to see if paid review have more 5 star reviews than unpaid reviews, conducted on Amazon games dataset

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:
  ### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  5,728 paid Vine reviews and 2,195,347 regular reviews
  
  ### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  2,536 paid 5-star reviews and 896,427 unpaid 5-star reviews
  
  ### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
  41.13% of paid reviews were 5-stars, 40.83% of unpaid reviews were 5-stars

## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.

Statistically, only 20% of games should be in the top 20% of stars, so there does seem to be a significant amount of positivity bias going on, despite the lack of bias in paid reviews. It would also be useful I think to conduct this analysis on the dataset which has not been filtered for helpful votes.
